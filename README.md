# Data Structures

`DataStructures` is a Rust project created for educational purposes, providing implementations of various data structures.

Each data structure is designed as a library with tests and documentation.


## Complexity

Here's a table showing the time complexity of various data structures:

| Data Structure | Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion | Space Complexity |
| -------------- | ------ | ------ | --------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Stack          | O(n)   | O(n)   | O(1)      | O(1)     | O(n)             |
